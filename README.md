A program creats that draws random numbers and stores them in an array.

The program stores only the numbers that have not already been drawn. Ie. the array must contain ONLY ONE instance of each number. 
All numbers drawn must be in the range of 100 to 999, both limits included.

When all the numbers are generated and stored in the array, the program should find the largest, smallest and average value of the numbers in the array.
Finally, the program should print, in a message box, the numbers in the array.
